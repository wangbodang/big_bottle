# Bigbootle: Make Green a Habit, Make Action Valuable

## Are you concerned about growing plastic pollution but unsure how to make a difference?

Every day, we contribute to plastic waste, often without realizing it. But simple choices can lead to significant change. Bigbootle is an innovative "Eco-Action-to-Earn" application that encourages and rewards you for choosing larger volume bottled beverages, helping to reduce plastic consumption right at the source and protect our planet together.

## Why is choosing bigger bottles so important?

* **Significantly Reduce Plastic Use:** Data shows that opting for a 2000ml large bottle instead of the equivalent volume in 300ml small bottles can cut down plastic usage by as much as **65%** per 100ml on average! Less plastic means less resource depletion and a lighter environmental footprint.
* **Improve Recycling Efficiency:** In many regions (like Japan and China), larger plastic bottles are prioritized for recycling and reuse due to their higher value. Choosing bigger bottles not only reduces the total amount of plastic but also increases the likelihood that it will be effectively recycled instead of ending up as waste.

## Your Environmental Actions Deserve Real Rewards!

By joining Bigbootle, you will:

* **Contribute to a Greener Planet:** Every time you choose a large bottle, you're actively supporting sustainable living. Together, our small actions create a significant positive impact on the future.
* **Earn Rewards with Real Value:** Through simple actions, you'll earn $B3TR tokens. **These aren't just virtual points!** $B3TR is a utility token issued by VebetterDAO, which you can spend in the real world using the exclusive **$B3TR Debit Card**, just like a regular bank card!

## Getting Started with Bigbootle is Easy:

1.  **Download the Wallet:** Go to the App Store or Google Play to download and install the **Veworld Wallet** application, ensuring your digital assets are secure.
2.  **Access the App:** Open the Bigbootle application (address: `bigbottle.vet`) through your **Veworld Wallet** app or other designated access points.
3.  **Connect Your Wallet:** Authorize the connection between your Veworld Wallet and Bigbootle.
4.  **Upload Your Receipt:** After purchasing a bottled beverage, simply take a clear photo of the sales receipt with your phone and upload it.
    * **Receipt Requirements:** To accurately record your contribution, please ensure the photo clearly shows the **purchase date**, the **beverage product name**, and, most importantly, the **drink volume**. There are no restrictions on the brand or type of beverage.

## How Rewards Work - Simple and Clear!

* **Bigger Volume = More Points:**
    * Drink Volume < 700ml = **1 Point**
    * Drink Volume 700ml to < 2000ml = **10 Points**
    * Drink Volume â‰¥ 2000ml = **15 Points**
* **Share the Weekly $B3TR Pool:** Each week, we distribute $B3TR tokens to users based on the proportion of points they earned compared to the total points earned by all users that week. The greater your contribution, the more rewards you receive!
* **Reward Cap:** To encourage broader participation, each user can earn a maximum of **300 $B3TR** per week.

## Trust and Transparency Drive a Green Future

Bigbootle is built on the secure and efficient **Vechain blockchain technology**. This means every environmental contribution you make, the points you earn, and the $B3TR rewards you receive are recorded transparently and immutably on the blockchain, ensuring fairness and trust.
